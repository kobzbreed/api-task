## Problem Description:

You are to create a SPA (Single Page Application) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people). Read the documentation and implement as follows.

### Process ?

1. Display an image for each of the characters. Preferrably a unique image for each but you could also choose to use a dummy image for all of them.

2. Make a HTTP request to the star wars API and use the result from the request to populate your frontend application

- Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.
- On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only

3. All implementations should be done using es6.

4. Make your design pretty and responsive.

5. When you are done, host your application on netlify (submit link should be added to your turned in field on Teams)
